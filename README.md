# Active Scan +++
More scan checks because Burp's scanner is good, but I want more. 

To use simply install the extention and run an active scan. 

The CORS check will take the domain from a valid origin header and use that as a "trusted" domain to test bypasses on. Therefore it is worth running the scan against different requests with different Origin header values.
